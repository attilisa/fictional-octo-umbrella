IMAGE STEGANOGRAPY

This project is on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a steganographic technique whereby secret messages are to be embedded in digital images. 
It would involve the creation of algorithms for the embedding of data into the image and another algorithm for the extraction of the data from the stego-image without 
loss of visual quality of the cover image. 
This would be a highly suggested advanced image steganography system in which to securely embed and extract hidden information within a digital image.
It shall use very sophisticated algorithms so that a human viewer does not get any feel of its imperceptibility, and it is resilient against normal image 
processing operations like compression, resizing, and format conversions.
